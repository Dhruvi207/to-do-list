# to-do-list

I have created a to-do list using HTML CSS and JavaScript.You can add new list item by clicking "Add" button, and you can remove items by clicking cross icon. You can also mark task as comple by clicking on the item or circle icon before list items. If the user clicks on "Add" button without entering a task,an alert message will appear. This to-do list will be saved in the browser, so your tasks will remain evev if you refresh or close the browser.
